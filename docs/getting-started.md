# Getting Started

## Playground

Nothing better than a quick `playground` to understand how things work.

You can select a sample using the `select` on the left, and execute with the `play` button on the right.

Also, toggles are available on the bottom of each `Command` in order to set the result as a `failure` or a `success`.

## Quick Start

We highly suggests to get familiar with <Anchor href="/features/commands">Commands</Anchor> and <Anchor href="/features/chains">Chains</Anchor>.

Then you can start creating your own `chains` and `commands` to suit your particular needs.

A great use of `Duncan` could be around `HTTP` requests, sent to a server.

You could even make great use of <Anchor href="https://github.com/genesys/mollitia">Mollitia</Anchor>, that would add resilience to your chains.
